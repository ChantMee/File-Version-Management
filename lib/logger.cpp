    * DEBUG: 
    * This level is mainly used when debugging programs.

    * 
    * WARNING:
    * This level is used when the user does something wrong.
    * For example, if the user tries to access a folder that does not exist, the
    * function will only return false, because it is printed this way.
    * To find out exactly what happened, you can use the logger's "information" variable.
    * 
    * FATAL:
    * This level records information that may cause the program to crash.
    * At this level, information will be forced to be output to the console 
    * through cerr and the log level will be marked.
    * Due to the limited level of the author, errors of this level are 
    * almost never caught. QAQ
